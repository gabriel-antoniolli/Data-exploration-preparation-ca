Assessment Task
This is a pair-based project (Max 2 students) using R programming language or any other language of your
choice. Analyse a specific problem only in the one of following areas
● Crime
● Covid 19
● Dublin Transport
The dataset should have at least 7000 rows and 10 columns after cleaning and there is not any upper
bound. The type of question(s) that you should formulate for the project will depend on the chosen domain
of the dataset that your pair is considering for the Data Exploration and Preparation (DEP) project. The
objectives of the DEP project are based on the domain knowledge of data. The pair would need to complete
the following tasks during the development of this pair project.

a) Identify which variables are categorical, discrete and continuous in the chosen data set and show
using some visualization or plot. Explore whether there are missing values for any of the variables.

b) Calculate the statistical parameters (mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation)
for each of the numerical variables.

c) Apply Min-Max Normalization, Z-score Standardization and Robust scalar on the numerical data
variables.

d) Line, Scatter and Heatmaps can be used to show the correlation between the features of the
dataset.

e) Graphics and descriptive understanding should be provided along with Data Exploratory analysis
(EDA). Identify subgroups of features that can explore some interesting facts.

f) Apply dummy encoding to categorical variables (at least one variable used from the data set) and
discuss the benefits of dummy encoding to understand the categorical data.

g) Apply PCA with your chosen number of components. Write up a short profile of the first few
components extracted based on your understanding.

h) What is the purpose of dimensionality reduction? Explore the situations where you can gain the
benefit of dimensionality reduction for data analysis.

Your pair will present their findings and defend the results in the report (MS Doc/ pdf or any other readable
format). Your report should capture the following aspects that are relevant to your project investigations.

i) Description of problem domain, motivation, data set chosen and challenges faced during this project.
Your pair should provide the characterization, description and explanation of techniques used to
prepare the data set (size / attributes / missing values / outliers).
(15 marks)

ii) Find unusual patterns by identifying variations and covariation between the features in the dataset
and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to justify outcomes with supporting questions and
visualizations.
(20 marks)

iii) Show the implementation of an encoding scheme, such as one-hot, Label etc. Apply Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) for the dimensionality reduction on the chosen dataset. Interpret and
explain the outcomes obtained using PCA.
(15 marks)

iv) Provide an explanation of the code submitted along with the project (Code must be commented).
Conclusions of the project should be specified at the end of the report. Citations and references to be
in Harvard Style.
(10 marks)

v) Each team member presents a PowerPoint presentation of their work (maximum 5 slides) to
emphasize their distinctive contributions based on their involvement in the project's conceptual
understanding, code development, and deployment.
(20 marks individual)

vi) Each team member fully described their individual contributions to the project in a reflective journal,
using at least 400 to 500 words as well as images, diagrams, figures, and visualizations to elaborate
his/ her work.
